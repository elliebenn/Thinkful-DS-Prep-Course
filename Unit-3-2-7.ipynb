    "Reframe the question:  Popular for whom?  If popularity refers to residency, then sampling from AirBnB biases the data toward tourists.  A \"popular neightborhood\" for tourists is dependent on cost, locations of shopping or night life, access to metro lines, distance from tourist attractions. etc.  A popular neighborhood for residents factors in location and quality of schools and parks, nearest grocery stores, safety, commute times from work, etc.  \n",

This survey was also given online, which excludes Armenians who don't use or have access to the Internet (i.e. low income individuals).  I would limit my conclusions to the most common reasons Armenian college students visit local pubs, or expand the sample population beyond college students."
