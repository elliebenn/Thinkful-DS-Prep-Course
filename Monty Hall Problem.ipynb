    "## Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the classic problems in this space is referred to as the Monty Hall Problem. Some people even use this as an interview question! It is deceptively simple, and really digging into it reveals a myriad of approaches and some serious applications of conditional probability. The story goes like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write up some notes on this problem, including how you think Bayes' Rule might apply. Drop a link to your notes below and discuss it with your mentor.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always switch!\n",
    "\n",
    "At start, the probability of picking the car is 1 out of 3, and the probability of picking the goat is 2 out of 3.\n",
    "When the host reveals the other goat door, he is giving you more information, thus making the choice less random.  Given that it is two times more likely you picked the goat door to begin with, switching means you would get the car 100% of the time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By revealing the second goat door, the probability of you getting the car goes from 1/3 to 2/3, as you essentially have two chances of picking the car door instead of one.\n"
